# Alegria_CS-250_Project2

I felt like I was able to get to do a good job with the input validations with this project.

I believe i could have done a better job using my putput comments to lead the user. I noticed a few spelling errors as well when i reviewed this project.I find that this could be distracting to the user

one piece of code that tripped me up was getting the code to calculate the earnings. I understood the formula quite well, however i had a hard time understanding how to put that into code form.I over came this by referencing W3Schools to help find a solution to using the for loop to plug in the formula.

I feel like the use of loops and classes are two things i will see alot of when coding and this project helped me gain a better understanding of how and when they should be used. 

While having multiple files of code can be difficult to flow together, it is a great way to keep code clean and organized. I really like that design because to me it makes it easier to identify bugs and to make changes to the code later.
